## Open work

- **Port the accepted web Learn redesign to Android.** Web v0.914 is accepted
  and merged; Android still ships its existing practice UI. Port
  `core/data-tables.js`, `core/learn-tutorial.js`, `core/learn-coach.js` and
  `core/editor-core.js` deliberately, adapt Android styles, answer-line overlay
  and coach anchors, then verify the mobile flow on a device without building
  an APK unless explicitly requested.
